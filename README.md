# Kinematic_Arm_Model

This folder contains a kinematic arm model that contains 20 degrees of freedom at the elbow, wrist, and finger joints. This model is compatible with OpenSim software.

The model was adapted from the one put forward in Saul et al. 2015 and then published in Yough et al. 2021. The latter is available in the "Documents" section of the OpenSim project page.
